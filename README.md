# advent-of-code-2020

This repository contains my solutions for the 2020 Advent of Code event in Python.
I completed these puzzles while the event was active in 2020.
The main objective was to refresh my python skills, learn more about algorithms, and practice applying different CS and Math concepts.
Some topics explored include graph theory (using networkx), linear algebra (computations with adjacency matrices), 
geometry (coordinate systems), number theory/combinatorics (counting and iterative solutions), and boolean logic (boolean satisfiability and logic puzzles).
